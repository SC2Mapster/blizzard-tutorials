TEXT EDITOR INTRODUCTION
========================

The Text Editor is a central hub for controlling all of the text inputs
present in an entire project. Here you'll find a top-down overview of
every single text-containing entity found in the map. These may include
mission screens and debriefings, game-time transmissions and written
dialog, right down to variable and parameter names. The Text Editor
offers a collected way of handling all text and is intended primarily
for use as a time-saver for global edits and an entry point for
inputting large amounts of text into the game for later use.
