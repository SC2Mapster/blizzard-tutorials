# Standard Dependencies

Every data asset used in the StarCraft II trilogy is distributed through a dependency mod. These Standard Dependencies build on the game's base Core.SC2Mod and supply assets relevant to a specific version of StarCraft. This article breaks down each standard dependency with information on its purpose and contents, both in terms of assets and other dependencies.
